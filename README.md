This project is to perform Exploratory Analysis and identify if there are important features that determine whether a product whether or not gets delivered on time and build a predictive model that can determine the arrival time of any product.
## COMPANY OVERVIEW
GoKart is an international e-commerce enterprise based in Nigeria. It offers a diverse range of products through its online platform, catering to a widespread international audience.
With its innovative approach to online shopping, GoKart provides customers with convenient access to an extensive selection of items.
## PROBLEM OVERVIEW
 GoKart faces the challenge of understanding and catering to the diverse needs and preferences of their customers.
The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Analysis and identify if there are important features that determine whether a product whether or not gets delivered on time and build a predictive model that can determine the arrival time of any product.
## DATA SOURCE
The data was provided by 10alytics.
## DATA PREPROCESSING
Machine learning preprocessing was performed before introducing the machine learning models. These processes involved missing values, scaling features, and class imbalance.
## MACHINE LEARNING MODELS.
This project involves building supervised ML models. The training and testing dataset was split. The classification models used were; -Logistic regression -Random Forest -Decision Tree
## EVALUATION METRICS
The performance was evaluated using the following Machine learning models; -Precision: The proportion of correctly identifying transactions among all transactions classified. -Recall: Proportion of correctly identifying arrival time of any product -F1 score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced metric for model evaluation.
